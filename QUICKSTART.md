## 💡 Dream Writing Tips

### Best Results

- **Be specific about colors**: "purple sky", "red shadows"
- **Describe emotions**: "scary", "peaceful", "wonderful"
- **Mention movement**: "floating", "flying", "falling"
- **Include objects**: "stars", "trees", "water", "creatures"
- **Be vivid**: More descriptive = better visualization

### Example Dreams

**Peaceful Nature**

```
I walked through a peaceful garden filled with green vines and golden 
light. Butterflies danced around me while soft music played.
```

**Intense Fear**

```
I was running through a dark forest, being chased by shadows. 
Everything was black and purple, and I couldn't escape the nightmare.
```

**Surreal Wonder**

```
I floated through space surrounded by pink and blue stars. Time moved 
backwards and shapes morphed into impossible forms. It was magical.
```

**Mixed Emotions**

```
The sky was both beautiful and terrifying. Red clouds turned into 
creatures while I fell slowly through layers of reality.
```
